Thank you for choosing cFTP. This software allows you to upload files for specific clients, and keep them stored for as long as you need them.

cFTP lets choose a name and description for each individual file you upload, and relate it to an existing client or create a new one.
When the upload is complete, the system wil give you a link that you can share, where you client can see and download every file available under his account.

Additionaly, you can select your own logo, that will appear in every client's page.
